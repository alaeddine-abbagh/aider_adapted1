## One-Sentence Use Case

**Given an HS code and sanctioned country, automatically determine if the transaction violates EU sanctions regulations and provide the regulatory justification.**

## Inputs

1. **HS code** (6, 8, or 10 digits) - e.g., "8703" for cars
2. **Country/jurisdiction** - e.g., Russia, Iran
3. **Transaction direction** - import or export
4. **Transaction parties** (optional) - originator, beneficiary

*Note: In future iterations, could also accept product descriptions and auto-extract HS codes*

## Outputs (Required)

1. **Regulatory conclusion:**
    - ✅ "Transaction is permissible"
    - ❌ "Transaction violates sanctions - STOP"
    - ⚠️ "Requires additional review"
2. **Justification:**
    - Is it a **dual-use good**? (Yes/No + reference to correlation table)
    - Is it **restricted** for this country? (Yes/No + specific EU regulation article/appendix)
    - Matching logic applied (exact match, partial match, etc.)
3. **Regulatory citations:**
    - Specific article/appendix number (e.g., "EU Reg 833-2014, Appendix 27")
    - Link or reference to regulation section
4. **Structured format** for insertion into EP system or analyst report template

## Key Requirement

The output must reference **latest versions** of regulations (they update weekly) and handle **large documents** (500+ pages)—this is why current RAG tools fail.
